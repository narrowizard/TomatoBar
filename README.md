## Overview
Have you ever heard of Pomodoro? It's a great technique to help you keep track of time and stay on task during your studies or work. Read more about it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a>.

TomatoBar is world's neatest Pomodoro timer for the macOS menu bar. All the essential features are here - configurable
work and rest intervals, optional sounds, discreet actionable notifications, global hotkey.

**This enhanced version adds work completion tracking with cloud synchronization support**, allowing you to record what you accomplish during each pomodoro session and sync the data to https://tomast.narro.cn for productivity analysis.

TomatoBar is fully sandboxed with no entitlements.

Download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/ivoronin/TomatoBar/releases/latest/">here</a> or install using Homebrew:
```
$ brew install --cask tomatobar
```

If the app doesn't start, install using the `--no-quarantine` flag:
```
$ brew install --cask --no-quarantine tomatobar
```

## Integration with other tools
### Event log
TomatoBar logs state transitions in JSON format to `~/Library/Containers/com.github.ivoronin.TomatoBar/Data/Library/Caches/TomatoBar.log`. Use this data to analyze your productivity and enrich other data sources.
### Starting and stopping the timer
TomatoBar can be controlled using `tomatobar://` URLs. To start or stop the timer from the command line, use `open tomatobar://startStop`.

### Work completion tracking (Enhanced in this version)
This enhanced version of TomatoBar includes work completion tracking with cloud synchronization support. When a work interval completes, you can:

1. Record what you accomplished during the pomodoro session
2. Upload the data to **https://tomast.narro.cn** for productivity tracking and analysis

To use this feature:
1. Open Settings â†’ API Endpoint
2. Configure your API endpoint (default: https://tomast.narro.cn)
3. When a work session completes, enter your accomplishments in the popup
4. The data will be automatically uploaded to your account

If no API endpoint is configured or upload fails, the data will be saved locally.
